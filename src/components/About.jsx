                <p>Hello, my name is Mel. After years of working as a graphic designer, I found my calling and fell in love with software engineering. That journey from designer to software engineer involved research, time, dedication, and curating my own curriculum for learning since I did not come from a Computer Science background. Through the process of online learning and the hands-on experience I gained the understanding that continuted education is paramount to success and moving forward in my career.

                    <br />
                    Iâ€™ve worked on various user centric projects from website pages to reusable React components to in&#8209;app new user journeys to integrating third&#8209;party&nbsp;tools. I'm seeking my next role to be a part of a collaborative team environment that fosters communication, trust, and continuous learning.
