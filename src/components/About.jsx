                <p>Hello, my name is Mel. After years of working as a graphic designer, I fell in love with web development. Through a lot of online courses, hands-on learning, and copious amounts of googling I was fortunate enough to professionally transition from a designer to web developer and eventually to software&nbsp;engineer.

                    Iâ€™ve worked on various user centric projects from website pages to reusable react components to in&#8209;app new user journeys to integrating third&#8209;party&nbsp;tools.
